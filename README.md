# Mass Re-dunce-dancy

**Strap in, fire some chumps, and let’s dismantle bureaucracy and society with style and a healthy dose of absurdity!**

## Fire Up the Chaos!

Ready to wreck the system? In **Mass Re-dunce-dancy**, you take on the role of a renegade executive set on demolishing bureaucracy.  
- **Click to fire government employees**  
- Earn **Fire Points** for every department you clear out  
- Upgrade your arsenal of satirical mayhem  
- Unleash your inner executive and watch the system crumble

## What's With These Popups?

As the leader of your country, you receive a report for each department you “save” in the name of cutting costs. Each popup pauses the game—both manual and auto-firing are halted—giving you **5 seconds** to reflect on your actions before the chaos resumes. Real-world consequences meet tongue-in-cheek absurdity in every decision.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Any events or outcomes referenced in this game are purely satirical. The game does not endorse real-world actions and is intended as a humorous critique of bureaucracy and governmental inefficiency.

## Play the Game

## How Was This Game Made?

The game is built with:
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling  
- **HTML5** and **JavaScript** for the gameplay  
- A dash of **ChatGPT** inspiration, observations from the news, and a few adult beverages for good measure

There are two core files:
1. **Master List** – Contains the game’s data (department names, number of employees, etc.) in a JSON format (think of it as a strings.xml for web apps).
2. **index.html** – The main file that pulls in the master list and drives the gameplay.

Feel free to modify the game text, adjust the numbers, or even add new departments to the master list.

## How Accurate Is the Data?

The current master list is based on publicly available data:
- Many numbers reflect real-world statistics from government reports.
- Some figures have been approximated to account for recent changes.
- If you spot a missing department or an error, please leave a comment on the game or contribute to the discussion on this post.

## Why Did I Make This Game?

When I was a high school senior learning HTML, I never imagined that 2025 would look like a scene straight out of a Ron Swanson wet dream.  
- **Mass Re-dunce-dancy** is a cathartic response to the chaos and confusion of modern governance.
- It’s a way to channel frustration into a humorous, interactive experience.
- Programming can be a powerful outlet, providing clarity—and laughter—in dark times.

## What's Next?

Future updates include:
- **Expanded Consequences:** More detailed reports with links to the positive impacts these departments make and resources for those affected by the layoffs.
- **Data Transparency:** Clearer sourcing for the numbers in the master list.
- **Story Expansions:** As current events evolve, so too will the narrative—expect more satirical twists and turns as the news provides fresh fodder.
